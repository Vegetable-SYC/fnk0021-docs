##############################################################################

**If you have any concerns, please feel free to contact us via** support@freenove.com

In this chapter, we will do some necessary preparation work: start your Pi Raspberry and install some necessary libraries.

If you are using remote desktop mode to login Raspberry Pi, you need use :ref:`VNC viewer`.

Step 0.1 Obtain the Code (Don|t skip this section.)
*************************************************************

Type the following commands in the terminal to obtain the code for the smart car. And place the code in the user directory "Pi". 

:red:`(Note: Here are two commands. Please execute commands in order.) Don|t transmit code from VNC, it may cause errors.`

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd ~
    $ git clone http://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_Three-wheeled_Smart_Car_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi.git

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/0_Software/Chapter00_00.png
    :align: center

You can also find and download the code in Raspberry Pi by visiting our official website (http://www.freenove.com) or our GitHub repository (https://github.com/freenove).

Please notice that our code for this smart car is written with Python3.

Set Python3 as default python (Don|t skip this section.)
===============================================================

First, execute python to check default python on your raspberry Pi. Press Ctrl-Z to exit.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/0_Software/Chapter00_01.png
    :align: center

If it is python3, you can skip this section.

If it is python2, you need execute following commands to set default python to python3.

1.	Enter directory /usr/bin 

.. code-block:: console
    
    $ cd /usr/bin

2.	Delete the old python link.

.. code-block:: console
    
    $ sudo rm python

3.	Create new python links to python.

.. code-block:: console
    
    $ sudo ln -s python3 python

4.	Check python. Press Ctrl-Z to exit.

.. code-block:: console
    
    $ python

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/0_Software/Chapter00_02.png
    :align: center

If you want to set python2 as default python in other projects.

Just repeat command above and change python3 to python2.

Shortcut Key
---------------------------

Now, we will introduce several shortcuts that are very useful and commonly used in terminal.

1. up and down arrow keys. History commands can be quickly brought back by using up and down arrow keys, which are very useful when you need to reuse certain commands.

When you need to type command, pressing “↑” will bring back the previous command, and pressing “↓” will bring back the latter command.

2. Tab key. The Tab key can automatically complete the command/path you want to type. When there are multiple commands/paths conforming to the already typed letter, pressing Tab key once won’t have any result. And pressing Tab key again will list all the eligible options. This command/path will be directly completed when there is only one eligible option.

As shown below, under the |~|directory, enter the Documents directory with the “cd” command. After typing “cd D”, press Tab key, then there is no response. Press Tab key again, then all the files/folders that begin with “D” is listed. Continue to type the character "oc", then press the Tab key, and then “Documents” is completed automatically.

Step 0.2 Configure I2C
********************************

Enable I2C
===========================

The I2C interface raspberry pi is closed in default. You need to open it manually. You can enable the I2C interface in the following way.

open the terminal:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/0_Software/Chapter00_05.png
    :align: center

Type command in the terminal:

.. code-block:: console
    
    $ sudo raspi-config

Then open the following dialog box:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/0_Software/Chapter00_06.png
    :align: center

Choose “5 Interfacing Options”“P5 I2C”“Yes”“Finish” in order and restart your RPi later. Then the I2C module is started.

Type a command to check whether the I2C module is started:

.. code-block:: console
    
    $ lsmod | grep i2c

If the I2C module has been started, the following content will be shown:

Install I2C-Tools
==================================

Type the command to install I2C-Tools.

.. code-block:: console
    
    $ sudo apt-get install i2c-tools

I2C device address detection:

.. code-block:: console
    
    $ i2cdetect -y 1

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/0_Software/Chapter00_08.png
    :align: center

If there are I2C devices connected to your RPi, here will display their I2C device address.

Install python-smbus
================================

Python-smbus is a module of the program Python, which contains some classes and methods to operate I2C.

Step 0.3 Install mjpg-streamer
*****************************************

Camera is driven by mjpg-streamer. So you need to install mjpg-streamer.

Install
=================================

Open the terminal and execute the following command to install.

1.	Install the relay for mjpg-streamer:

.. code-block:: console
    
    $ sudo apt-get install libv4l-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install libjpeg62-turbo-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install imagemagick

2.	You may also need to install SVN if it is not installed in your raspberry pi。
    
.. code-block:: console
    
    $ sudo apt-get install subversion

3.	Generate executable file mjpg-streamer: (Note: Here are two commands. Please execute  commands in order.)

.. code-block:: console
    
    $ cd ~/Freenove_Three-wheeled_Smart_Car_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi/mjpg-streamer
    $ make USE_LIBV4L2=true clean all

Test mjpg-streamer
==================================

Connect the camera to any one of the USB ports on the RPi. And execute the following command to verify that the camera is successfully connected to RPi.

.. code-block:: console
    
    $ ls /dev/video*

If the results list the video0, the camera is connected successfully.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/0_Software/Chapter00_14.png
    :align: center

Under the mjpg-streamer directory, execute the following command to open the mjpg-streamer service.

.. code-block:: console
    
    $ cd ~/Freenove_Three-wheeled_Smart_Car_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi/mjpg-streamer
