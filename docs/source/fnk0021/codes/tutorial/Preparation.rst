For more details, please refer to https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/faqs/#powerReqs

In addition, RPi also needs a network cable used to connect it to wide area network.

All of these components are necessary. Among them, the power supply is required at least 5V/2.5A, because lack of power supply will lead to many abnormal problems, even damage to your RPi. So power supply with 5V/2.5A is highly recommend. SD Card Micro (recommended capacity 16GB or more) is a hard drive for RPi, which is used to store the system and personal files. In later projects, the components list with a RPi will contains these required components, using only RPi as a representative rather than presenting details.

Optional Components
=================================

Under normal circumstances, there are two ways to login to Raspberry Pi: using independent monitor, or remote desktop to share a monitor with your PC.

Required Accessories for Monitor
---------------------------------------

If you want to use independent monitor, mouse and keyboard, you also need the following accessories.

1.Display with HDMI interface

2.Mouse and Keyboard with USB interface

As to Pi Zero and Pi Zero W, you also need the following accessories.

1.	Micro-HDMI to HDMI converter wire.

2.	Micro-USB to USB-A Receptacles converter wire (Micro USB OTG wire). 

3.	USB HUB.

4.	USB transferring to Ethernet interface or USB Wi-Fi receiver. 

For different Raspberry Pi, the optional items are slightly different. But all of their aims are to convert the special interface to standard interface of standard Raspberry Pi.

Now you can jumper to :ref:`VNC Viewer`.

Remote desktop & VNC
**********************************

If you don't have a spare display, mouse and keyboard for your RPi, you can use a remote desktop to share a display, keyboard, and mouse with your PC. Below is how to use remote desktop under the Windows operating system to control RPi. 

Under windows, Raspberry Pi can be generally accessed remotely through two applications. The first one is the windows built-in application remote desktop, which corresponds to the Raspberry Pi xrdp service. The second one is the free application VNC Viewer, which corresponds to the VNC interface of Raspberry Pi. Each way has its own advantages. You can choose either one or two.

+---------------------------+--------------+
|          Windows          | Raspberry Pi |
+===========================+==============+
| Remote Desktop Connection | Xrdp         |
+---------------------------+--------------+
| VNC Viewer                | VNC          |
+---------------------------+--------------+

VNC Viewer can not only run under Windows, but also under system MAC, Linux, IOS, Android and so on.

:red:`Some remote connection tools like Xrdp, it does not support opencv and pyqt window display. So it is recommended to use VNC Viewer to connect Raspberry Pi for this robot.`

SSH
=============================

Under previous Raspberry Pi OS, SSH is opened by default. Under the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS, it is closed by default. So you need to open it first.

**Method: after the system is written. Create a folder named “ssh” under generated boot disk, then the SSH connection will be opened.**

And then, download the tool software Putty. Its official address: http://www.putty.org/ 

Or download it here: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html 

Then use cable to connect your RPi to the routers of your PC LAN, to ensure your PC and your RPi in the same LAN. Then put the system Micro SD Card prepared before into the slot of the RPi and turn on the power supply waiting for starting RPi. Later, enter control terminal of the router to inquiry IP address named “raspberry pi”. For example, I have inquired to my RPi IP address, and it is “192.168.1.108". Then open Putty, enter the address, select SSH, and then click "OPEN", as shown below:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Preparation/Preparation10.png
    :align: center

There will appear a security warning at first login. Just click “YES”.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Preparation/Preparation11.png
    :align: center

Then there will be a login interface (RPi default user name: pi; the password: raspberry). When you enter the password, there will be no display on the screen. This is normal. After the correct input, press “Enter” to confirm.
